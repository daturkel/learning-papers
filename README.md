### Landmark Papers in Machine Learning

*This document attempts to collect the papers which developed important techniques in machine learning. Research is a collaborative process, discoveries are made independently, and the difference between the original version and a precursor can be subtle, but I’ve done my best to select the papers that I think are novel or significant.*

*My opinions are by no means the final word on these topics. Please create an issue or pull request if you have a suggestion.*

Links with a lock icon (🔒) indicate papers behind a paywall, though these papers are often available elsewhere. Links with a disk icon (💽) indicate code published alongside a paper.

Papers proceeded by “See also” indicate either additional historical context or else major developments, breakthroughs, or applications.
